# pcap_shuffle

Simple pcap file shuffler written in python.

This script takes pcap file as an input and produces version of it where the packets are in random order.

The input pcap file is not modified in any ways.

It requires dpkt library which can be installed with pip.

## usage

just provide input and output filenames for the script. 

For example, python pcap_shuffle.py input.pcap output.pcap.


## remarks

I wrote this script in less than 15 minutes so it's not perfect but it does what it's supposed to.
